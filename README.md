# Awesome Isolation

Bored? I like lists (a natural side effect of working with Agile!) so I decided to curate a few lists..which mainly point to other lists... buy you must be bored by now?!?!

Generally I've categorised around what I do - pull & commit if you want to add.


## Get Organised

While you're spending more time at home, you won't have the protection of your business - and you'll probably be using personal sites more than usual so I cannot emphasis this enough. *Think Secure*
* Get up-to-date by making sure that your home computing devices are fully patched and that any anti-virus, malware protection etc is fully setup
* Organise your storage
* Audit your accounts and check 
	* How strong are your passwords?
	* Do you re-use passwords?
	* Enable MFA. seriously - do this everywhere!
	* Enable App Specific Passwords
* Diversify your software and check the alternatives

## Get Community

I work in technology - and one of the things that amazes me the most over and over is that people don't seem to understand that someone somehwere probably did <insert any tech task> before - or at least tried and that will be somewhere for you to get a head start.

* Find online sources
* Get updates and stay informed
* Develop some filtering logic

If someone even mentions something to me now I seem to have a pattern I follow

	1. google it and see what top links there are
	2. Horde links of anything I think meets a pretty minimal  standard so I can reference it when I want to take a look
	3. Github - Search - Sort by Forks/Stars
	4. DockerHub 
	5. Ansible Galaxy

### Tooling

The Apps or Tools that make my life easier here are

* Pocket
* CodeHub
* Feedly

## Get Skills

Why not use your extra time to up yourskills? I much prefer hands on playing with new tech, but you can find yourself some good referemcematerial or courses and then examples from Github or Stack Overflow to get into the guts of things quickly

### Useful sites and Tools


## Get Creative

When we do tech, it pretty useless just trapped in your brain - and if you innovate and problem solve like I do, you need to share it so that it can start being used and - most importantly - enter a feedback loop so that you grow your skills and improve the effectiveness of what you've created (or stolen from github.. I am not here to judge)

* Get documenting
* Draw diagrams, flowchart, UML - anything that expresses the concepts or ideas to others
* Present to your peers
* Prepare to present to your customers
* Write a guide
* Do a video
* Blog it or share to the wider world


## Get Chillaxed

The internet is a wonderful place. It is also very weird... Here a list of stuff that keeps me sane-ish and definitly helps me with the weird.

## Get Unchained

This section is just for me to share the tools and techniques I've developed or stolen to be able to work flexibly and communicate effectively - whether I'm working remotely or supporting an incident while sitting on the toilet the other side of the world
