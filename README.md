# Awesome Isolation

Bored? I like lists (a natural side effect of working with Agile!) so I decided to curate a few lists..which mainly point to other lists... buy you must be bored by now?!?!

Generally I've categorised around what I do - pull & commit if you want to add.


## Get Organised

While you're spending more time at home, you won't have the protection of your business - and you'll probably be using personal sites more than usual so I cannot emphasis this enough. *Think Secure*
* Get up-to-date by making sure that your home computing devices are fully patched and that any anti-virus, malware protection etc is fully setup
* Organise your storage
* Audit your accounts and check 
	* How strong are your passwords?
	* Do you re-use passwords?
	* Enable MFA. seriously - do this everywhere!
	* Enable App Specific Passwords
* Diversify your software and check the alternatives

## Get Community

I work in technology - and one of the things that amazes me the most over and over is that people don't seem to understand that someone somehwere probably did <insert any tech task> before - or at least tried and that will be somewhere for you to get a head start.

* Find online sources
* Get updates and stay informed
* Develop some filtering logic

If someone even mentions something to me now I seem to have a pattern I follow

	1. google it and see what top links there are
	2. Horde links of anything I think meets a pretty minimal  standard so I can reference it when I want to take a look
	3. Github - Search - Sort by Forks/Stars
	4. DockerHub 
	5. Ansible Galaxy
