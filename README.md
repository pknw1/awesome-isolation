Bored? I like lists (a natural side effect of working with Agile!) so I decided to curate a few lists..which mainly point to other lists... buy you must be bored by now?!?!

Generally I've categorised around what I do - pull & commit if you want to add.


## Get Organised
While you're spending more time at home, you won't have the protection of your business - and you'll probably be using personal sites more than usual so I cannot emphasis this enough. *Think Secure*
	* Get up-to-date by making sure that your home computing devices are fully patched and that any anti-virus, malware protection etc is fully setup
	* Organise your storage
	* Audit your accounts and check 
		* How strong are your passwords?
		* Do you re-use passwords?
		* Enable MFA. seriously - do this everywhere!
		* Enable App Specific Passwords
	* Diversify your software and check the alternatives

* Get Community

* Get Skills

* Get Creative

* Get Chillaxed

* Get Unchained

* Get Involved
